    <h2>The origins of Mosaics</h2>
    <p> Mosaics originated at around 3000 BCE. They originated 
        in ancient Mesopotamia because people would use small pebbles to create patterns.  
        Mosaics are pieces of art created by placing together small pieces of material such as ceramic, stone, and glass
         into patterns, or images. A common use for Mosaics are for decorating walls, ceilings, buildings, and floors. 
         A fun fact is that they have been popular ever since the ancient times, And some people use mosaics to depict, 
         or show gratitude to their religion.
